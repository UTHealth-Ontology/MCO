# Model Card Ontology
 
An OWL2-encoded ontology modeling the model card report for machine learning model assests. The aim of this work is to describe machine learning models to communicate information about specific details about the model (trade offs, intended users, licensing, etc.). As an ontology-based artifact we can semantically express, standarize, and yield computable benefits to the model card reports. 

This ontology utilizes: 
* Information Artifact Ontology, 
* Software Ontology (only a subset, see [SWO import](https://github.com/UTHealth-Ontology/MCO/tree/main/import) for details.)
* Provenance Ontology
* Simple Knowledge Organization System
